	abstract = {The flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) is a generalization of the classical job shop scheduling problem that allows to process operations on one machine out of a set of alternative machines. The FJSP is an NP-hard problem consisting of two sub-problems, which are the assignment and the scheduling problems. In this paper, we propose how to solve the FJSP by hybrid metaheuristics-based clustered holonic multiagent model. First, a neighborhood-based genetic algorithm (NGA) is applied by a scheduler agent for a global exploration of the search space. Second, a local search technique is used by a set of cluster agents to guide the research in promising regions of the search space and to improve the quality of the NGA final population. The efficiency of our approach is explained by the flexible selection of the promising parts of the search space by the clustering operator after the genetic algorithm process, and by applying the intensification technique of the tabu search allowing to restart the search from a set of elite solutions to attain new dominant scheduling solutions. Computational results are presented using four sets of well-known benchmark literature instances. New upper bounds are found, showing the effectiveness of the presented approach.},

	abstract = {Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs) is a language for the modelling and validation of systems in which concurrency, communication, and synchronisation play a major role. Coloured Petri Nets is a discrete-event modelling language combining Petri nets with the functional programming language Standard ML. Petri nets provide the foundation of the graphical notation and the basic primitives for modelling concurrency, communication, and synchronisation. Standard ML provides the primitives for the definition of data types, describing data manipulation, and for creating compact and parameterisable models. A CPN model of a system is an executable model representing the states of the system and the events (transitions) that can cause the system to change state. The CPN language makes it possible to organise a model as a set of modules, and it includes a time concept for representing the time taken to execute events in the modelled system. CPN Tools is an industrial-strength computer tool for constructing and analysing CPN models. Using CPN Tools, it is possible to investigate the behaviour of the modelled system using simulation, to verify properties by means of state space methods and model checking, and to conduct simulation-based performance analysis. User interaction with CPN Tools is based on direct manipulation of the graphical representation of the CPN model using interaction techniques, such as tool palettes and marking menus. A license for CPN Tools can be obtained free of charge, also for commercial use.},

	abstract = {Many interesting but practically intractable problems can be reduced to that of finding the ground state of a system of interacting spins. It is believed that the ground state of some naturally occurring spin systems can be effectively attained through a process called quantum annealing. Johnson et al. use quantum annealing to find the ground state of an artificial Ising spin system comprised of an array of eight superconducting flux qubits with programmable spin--spin couplings. With an increased number of spins, the system may provide a practical physical means to implement quantum algorithms, possibly enabling more effective approaches towards solving certain classes of hard combinatorial optimization problems.},

To support the modelling of scheduling problems, we provide a method to map tasks, resources and constraints onto a timed Petri net. By mapping scheduling problems onto Petri nets, we are able to use standard Petri net theory. In this paper we will show that we can use Petri net based tools and techniques to find conflicting and redundant precedences, upper- and lower-bounds for the makespan, etc. This is illustrated by a Petri net based analysis of the notorious 10×10 problem due to Fisher \& Thompson (1963)},

	abstract = {Quantum annealing is an emerging new platform for combinatorial optimization, requiring an Ising model formulation for optimization problems. The formulation can be an essential obstacle to the permeation of this innovation into broad areas of everyday life. Our research is aimed at the proposal of a Petri net modeling approach for an Ising model formulation. Although the proposed method requires users to model their optimization problems with Petri nets, this process can be carried out in a relatively straightforward manner if we know the target problem and the simple Petri net modeling rules. With our method, the constraints and objective functions in the target optimization problems are represented as fundamental characteristics of Petri net models, extracted systematically from Petri net models, and then converted into binary quadratic nets, equivalent to Ising models. The proposed method can drastically reduce the difficulty of the Ising model formulation.},

@article{jsSR,
	abstract = {Job Shop Scheduling is a combinatorial optimization problem of particular importance for production environments where the goal is to complete a production task in the shortest possible time given limitations in the resources available. Due to its computational complexity it quickly becomes intractable for problems of interesting size. The emerging technology of Quantum Annealing provides an alternative computational architecture that promises improved scalability and solution quality. However, several limitations as well as open research questions exist in this relatively new and rapidly developing technology. This paper studies the application of quantum annealing to solve the job shop scheduling problem, describing each step required from the problem formulation to the fine-tuning of the quantum annealer and compares the solution quality with various classical solvers. Particular attention is devoted to aspects that are often overlooked, such as the computational cost of representing the problem in the formulation required by the quantum annealer, the relative qubits requirements and how to mitigate chain breaks. Furthermore, the impact of advanced tools such as reverse annealing is presented and its effectiveness discussed. The results indicate several challenges emerging at various stages of the experimental pipeline which bring forward important research questions and directions of improvement.},

@article{qaoa,
	abstract = {Quantum Approximate Optimization algorithm (QAOA) aims to search for approximate solutions to discrete optimization problems with near-term quantum computers. As there are no algorithmic guarantee possible for QAOA to outperform classical computers, without a proof that bounded-error quantum polynomial time (BQP) ≠nondeterministic polynomial time (NP), it is necessary to investigate the empirical advantages of QAOA. We identify a computational phase transition of QAOA when solving hard problems such as SAT---random instances are most difficult to train at a critical problem density. We connect the transition to the controllability and the complexity of QAOA circuits. Moreover, we find that the critical problem density in general deviates from the SAT-UNSAT phase transition, where the hardest instances for classical algorithms lies. Then, we show that the high problem density region, which limits QAOA's performance in hard optimization problems (reachability deficits), is actually a good place to utilize QAOA: its approximation ratio has a much slower decay with the problem density, compared to classical approximate algorithms. Indeed, it is exactly in this region that quantum advantages of QAOA over classical approximate algorithms can be identified.},

@article{qaoaMaxcut,
	abstract = {The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising method of solving combinatorial optimization problems using quantum computing. QAOA on the MaxCut problem has been studied extensively on graphs with specific structure; however, little is known about the general performance of the algorithm on arbitrary graphs. In this paper, we investigate how different graph characteristics correlate with QAOA performance at depths at most three on the MaxCut problem for all connected non-isomorphic graphs with at most eight vertices. Some good predictors of QAOA success relate to graph symmetries, odd cycles, and density. For example, on eight vertex graphs, the average probability for selecting an optimal solution for graphs that contain no odd cycles after three iterations of QAOA is {\$}{\$}60.6{$\backslash$}{\%}{\$}{\$}compared to {\$}{\$}48.2{$\backslash$}{\%}{\$}{\$}for those that do. The data generated from these studies are shared in a publicly accessible database to serve as a benchmark for QAOA calculations and experiments. Knowing the relationship between structure and performance can be used to identify classes of combinatorial problems that are likely to exhibit a quantum advantage.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work we show how to use a quantum adiabatic algorithm to solve multiobjective optimization problems. For the first time, we demonstrate a theorem proving that the quantum adiabatic algorithm can find Pareto-optimal solutions in finite-time, provided some restrictions to the problem are met. A numerical example illustrates an application of the theorem to a well-known problem in multiobjective optimization. This result opens the door to solve multiobjective optimization problems using current technology based on quantum annealing.},

@article{quantumMultiobjective,
	abstract = {Multiobjective optimization has a wide range of applications in science and engineering. Various multiobjective optimization algorithms work fine for bi-objective problems with few variables. However, many problems involve several functions that handle many variables each, and there is no efficient mathematical method to solve these types of problems. Quantum computers offer an exponential speed-up for such problems when they take full advantage of quantum phenomena. At present, quantum multiobjective problem solvers for quantum computers do not exist. This paper presents a formal statistical analysis of two state-of-the-art classical multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and three quantum-inspired multiobjective optimization algorithms to determine whether quantum solvers can provide comparatively optimal quality solutions or if they are limited. One of the quantum-inspired algorithms tested is a novel proposal that uses fewer qubits. The paper also presents contributions to the state of the art by modifying two original, quantum-inspired algorithms to perform in continuous search spaces. The purpose of this paper is to settle the first step of multiobjective quantum optimization for quantum computers from quantum-inspired algorithms by providing valuable results that can assist in future research along the way in this field. The results indicated that the quantum-inspired algorithms tested performed as well as the NSGA-II, and the proposed method outperforms the other quantum-inspired algorithms in problems with constraints and complicated Pareto sets.},
